# Automatic-Readability-Checker
Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated texts. 
But how do you estimate the level of difficulty of a given text, and how do you teach a computer to do that? 
This program determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is most suitable.

### Program Objectives:
* This program calculates readability metrics (AKA readability tests) for natural language by using metrics such as word length, sentence length, number of characters, number of syllables and polysyllables. 
* The program has four available readability score options - Automated Readability Index, Fleschâ€“Kincaid readability tests, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and Coleman-Liau index.
* How each score is calculated can be easily found in wikipedia or other sources.
* Finally, the program suggests by what average age is the text understood.
